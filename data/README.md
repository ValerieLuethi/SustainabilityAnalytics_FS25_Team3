## massbalance_observation.csv

Winter/Summer/Annual mass balance (Bw/Bs/Ba) → millimeters water equivalent (mm w.e.), representing the amount of snow accumulated in winter/summer/annually converted to the equivalent depth of water.
The Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) -> the elevation on a glacier where annual accumulation equals annual ablation. (If temperatures rise or snowfall decreases, the ELA rises.)
Minimum and maximum elevation of glacier → Determines vertical gradient and exposure to temperature changes.

Date range: 1981-01-01 to 2020-12-01
catchment = a land area, bounded by natural high points like hills or mountains, where all water, including rainfall and snowmelt, collects and drains into a single common outlet, such as a river, lake, or the ocean

waterlevel_m: observed daily water head above sea level in meters
discharge_vol_m3s: observed catchment discharge m3/s
discharge_specific_mm: observed catchment-specific discharge (converted to millimetres per day using catchment areas)
precipitation_mm: observed daily summed precipitation in mm/d
temp_min: observed daily minimum temperature in Celsius
temp_mean: observed daily averaged temperature in Celsius
temp_max: observed daily maximum temperature in Celsius
rel_sunshine-duration: observed daily averaged relative sunshine (solar irradiance ≥ 200 W m−2) duration in %
snow_water_equiv_mm: observed daily averaged snow water equivalent in mm (=it is the height of water that would result if you melted the snow down to its liquid state)
